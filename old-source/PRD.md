# T-Dictionary Chrome Extension - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Product Overview
T-Dictionary is a Chrome browser extension that allows users to easily translate selected text on any webpage and save words/phrases for later review. The extension activates when users highlight text and click on the extension icon.

## Core Features

### 1. Text Selection and Translation

- Upon selection, the extension icon becomes active
- Clicking the icon or using a keyboard shortcut triggers translation
- Translations appear in a small popup near the selected text

### 2. Word Storage
- Translated words can be saved to a personal dictionary with one click
- Each saved word includes:
  - Original text
  - Translation
  - Source language
  - Context (sentence where the word appeared)
  - Time stamp
  - Optional user notes

### 3. Dictionary Management
- Users can access their saved words through the extension popup
- Features for dictionary management:
  - Search functionality
  - Categorization/tagging
  - Export/import capabilities
  - Review mode for learning

### 4. User Interface
- Clean, minimalist design
- Easy-to-use popup for translations
- Separate page for dictionary management
- Options page for customization

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Extension Structure
- manifest.json - Configuration file (manifest v3)
- Background service worker - For core functionality
- Content scripts - For interaction with webpage content
- Popup UI - For user interactions

## User Flow

1. User installs the extension
2. User navigates to any webpage
3. User highlights a word or phrase they want to translate
4. User clicks the extension icon or uses keyboard shortcut
5. Translation appears in a popup
6. User can click "Save" to add the word to their personal dictionary
7. User can access their dictionary of saved words via the extension popup
